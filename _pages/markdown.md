## Video games & Live streaming

Video game is a key area of interest for me. I founded a team of 7 members and represented the University of Nottingham Ningbo China to participate in the Zhejiang University E-sports League, which had around 20,000 participants. Our team finally won the fourth place in the trials. In addition, I have been actively sharing game tips and strategies with other players through my video game livestreaming channel, which has gained over 10,000 subscribers on Huya Live as of 2022. These experiences not only brought me a lot of joy, but also helped me develop strong communication and leadership skills.

## Teaching

Teaching is also a passion of mine because I really love the Feynman learning technique which involves explaining concepts to others to deepen my own understanding. Teaching not only helps me solidify my own knowledge, but it also allows me to share my knowledge and experience with others, and help them achieve their own learning goals.

I am currently responsible for teaching the techniques for design and performance analysis of algorithms for a variety of computational problems. The teaching content mainly includes asymptotic notations, bounding summations, recurrences, best-case, worst-case, average-case analysis, and design techniques such as divide and conquer, greedy method, dynamic programming and maximum flow algorithm.

I've also had the opportunity to teach Python programming to non-professionals in the past, and it's been an interesting and rewarding experience. Although it can be challenging to explain complex concepts in a way that's easy for non-technical people to understand, I've found that breaking things down into simple, relatable terms can go a long way. It's also important to be patient and encouraging, and to give your students plenty of opportunities to practice and ask questions.

## I'm still looking for more of my interests...
