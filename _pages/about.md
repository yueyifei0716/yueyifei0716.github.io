I am currently an Honours Year student at the [University of Sydney (USYD)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), within the School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering. Prior to USYD, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), Faculty of Engineering. During my time there, I had the opportunity to study as an exchange student at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), School of Computing. Before I transferred to UNSW, I finished 3 years of undergraduate study at the [University of Nottingham (UoN)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), Department of Computer Science.

Research
======

I am passionate about the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. In natural language processing, I am particularly interested in topic modeling, sentiment analysis, word embedding techniques and large language models. For computer vision, I have a strong interest in  image/video processing, medical image computing, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, multimedia computing, supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation. My enthusiasm for these research areas stems from my desire to explore and understand the capabilities of machine intelligence in processing and interpreting complex data, as well as their potential applications in various fields.
