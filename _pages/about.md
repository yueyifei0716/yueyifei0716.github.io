Hello! I am currently a third-year B.Sc. Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/">University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)</a> (since Fall 2018) and I served as one of the student representatives in 2018-2019. I have research interests in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Open-source projects can be found at my <a href='https://github.com/yueyifei0716'>[Github]</a>.
